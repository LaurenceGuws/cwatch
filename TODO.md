## Focus and selection unification
- [x] Build shared selectable list controller + widgets for consistent focus/selection across list views.
- [x] Add theme tokens for list interaction colors and wire them into the shared widgets.
- [x] Migrate HostList to the shared selectable list primitives.
- [ ] Migrate Docker/Kubernetes/file explorer lists to the shared primitives.
- [ ] Add tests for the selection controller and a representative widget (e.g., HostList).
