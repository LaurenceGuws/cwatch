Bugs:
    Explorer:
    -> Deleting file not updating folder view.
    -> Breadcrum/textpath looks terrible on mobile if location is deep in folder structure.

Issues:
    Editor:
    -> Tree-sitter's syntax highlighting is not working nicely, making random chars random colors.
       Tree-sitter lib isn't batteries included so its not easy for multiple OS targets.
       We need to use a better suited library, or redesign the editor. We aren't building an IDE, we are adding a decent editing feature.
      I also want to change it from a popup dialog to a standalone tab.

    Explorer:
    -> No create new file/folder option. Add in no-select rightclick menu and settings gear icon menu.
    -> Our file icon identification needs to expand dramatically. We are targetting techincal and non-technical clients.
       We can add icons for popular software, vendors, sass or whatever.

    General:
    -> User input dialogs should be more keyboard friendly, accepting enter and crtl+c as input.
