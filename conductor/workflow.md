# Project Workflow - CWatch

## Development Process
- **Task Management:** Work is organized into tracks, each with a specific plan.
- **Testing:** No automated test coverage requirements are enforced for this project.
- **Commits:**
    - **Manual Commits Only:** Conductor will NOT perform automatic commits after tasks or phases. The user is responsible for committing changes.
    - **History Integrity:** NEVER change or rewrite git history (e.g., no rebasing, force-pushing, or amending) unless explicitly requested by the user.

## Task Summaries
- Task summaries and progress tracking should be recorded in the track's `plan.md`.

## Verification Protocol
- Each phase must be manually verified by the user before proceeding.
